============

Python packages for calculating static fluid properties

TA-062014
The task at hand is to be able to model the fluid properties of a fuel oil in a bunker tank or in a fluid line.
The incoming information stream consists of viscosity, pressure, flow velocity and temperature coordinates. The packages here should be able to calculate composition of the oil from standard, known viscosity and density values and the volume of each fluid that goes through the pipe.
